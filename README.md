# Emotion Detector using TensorFlow


Welcome to the Emotion Detector project developed during the Google AI Fest hackathon. This project focuses on recognizing human emotions using TensorFlow, a powerful deep learning framework.

## Overview

Emotion detection is a fascinating field with various applications in human-computer interaction, psychology, and marketing. In this project, we have created a deep learning model that can identify emotions in images of human faces.



## Features

- Emotion recognition in real-time.
- Pre-trained model for quick start.
- Customizable for different emotion sets.
- User-friendly graphical interface (GUI).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.10.x
- TensorFlow
- Numpy
